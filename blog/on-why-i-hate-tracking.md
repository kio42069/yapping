# on why i hate tracking

*[Content appears to be placeholder in the original - this post was created but not filled out yet]*

Coming soon... when I actually finish writing this rant about tracking and privacy invasion.

For now, just know that I really, really hate being tracked online. More thoughts to follow when I'm less lazy about finishing this post.
