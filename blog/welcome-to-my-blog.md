# why

Why this goofy ass blog and not any well developed social media like oh maybe instagram or twitter

- because of the fken ai generated low quality slop
- because of the bombardment of personalised ads
- because of the absolute shithousery of bot accounts

dead internet theory be looking pretty real rn

## but i do wanna keep yapping publicly

i dont want to lose connection with the 20 ppl i broadcast my shitposting and thoughts to now do i

a blog would be pretty epic considering now my "stories" are now not limited to 24 hours, and hence anyone who did not have the time to check it out within that specific period would not miss out on the absolute fire my brain cooks every now and then

## any plans?
tbf nothing solid, atm i can think of 
1. just regular short thought / stories
2. tech/electronics/games posting
3. rants
4. picture dumps (like rarely, monthly or semesterly dunno whenever i got enough for a spam lol)

and yea thats pretty much it feel free to drop by sometimes to check out whats new
