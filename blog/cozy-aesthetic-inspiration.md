# creating cozy vibes ✨

lately i've been really drawn to soft, cozy aesthetics. there's something so comforting about pastels, warm lighting, and cute decorative elements that just makes everything feel more peaceful~

## what makes something feel "cozy"?

for me, cozy aesthetics include:

- **soft color palettes** - think blush pinks, cream whites, sage greens
- **natural textures** - wood, cotton, wool, dried flowers  
- **warm lighting** - fairy lights, candles, golden hour vibes
- **personal touches** - handmade items, photos, collections of tiny treasures

## inspiration sources

some of my favorite places to find cozy inspiration:

- **pinterest boards** with cottagecore and soft aesthetic themes
- **indie game art** - so many games have the most beautiful cozy environments
- **small artists on social media** who share their daily life and creative spaces
- **vintage items** that have stories and character

## bringing it into digital spaces

even online, we can create cozy feelings through:

- choosing soft, harmonious color schemes
- using gentle, rounded typography  
- adding small decorative elements
- sharing personal, authentic content

what makes *you* feel cozy? i'd love to hear about it in the comments! ♡
