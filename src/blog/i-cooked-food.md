No we shan't question the image quality I know my phone camers is very crusty musty dusty but it tasted DELICIOUS

Okay well we didn't end up making the crispy corn because the corn was well, sad

Can't make a standalone happy dish with a sad main ingredient now can we?

So mom just said no issue just put it in the gravy it'll taste nice

And taste nice it did!!

This is the part where I should relaly explain a bit of the cooking process
