# nostalgia
I used to have a wattpad back in 2018-2020. The plan was to write a fictional, superhero, sci-fi trilogy kind of in the YA genre.

I had massive plans for the trilogy
- [The Datraw Chronicles](#the-datraw-chronicles)
- [The Legendary Solars](#the-legendary-solars)
- [The Rise of A.L.P.H.A](#the-rise-of-alpha)

### The Datraw Chronicles

![book-cover](https://kiddofour.netlify.app/images/datraw-pages.jpg)

The premise of this story was a dying set of worlds, being taken over by some malevolent creature, or group of creatures (I don't really recollect it too well) attacking our (current) main character and his friend's wife, destroying their entire planet, and forcing them to seek shelter in a nearing planet.

On a side note, the names of the characters were not originally created or crafted by me. I used this thing called a "Free Online Random Character Name Generator". Yeah you cna guess how shit those names were...

Some important historical figures 🎀
- Lord Alder Hansen 
- Lord Strom Hammond
- Serbert Flagg
- Edred Carolinus
- Kenelm Black
- Belgarath Normandy 

Current day characters 🎆
- Esméralda Quagmire 
- Tom Huang
- The Dark Lord Cranium
- Lord Tristan Atherton
- Lord Phineas

The two tribes? The Ridas and the Canes

The planet names? Destraayae and Valhamen

What do they call portals? Latrops, you might take a wild guess how I came up with *that*

What do they call their spaceships? Dopecaps 😭

I can go on and on about how the production quality bar was in absolute hell, but we got the other stories to critique too

The regular old sci-fi shenanigans happen, an alien child is sent to earth, and cue the second book!

I actually managed to scrape a couple of the initial chapters off from some book publisihing website called reedsy I used to ideate back when I was starting out? I'll attach those couple chapters down below

### The Legendary Solars

I wasn't able to find the cover i cooked up for this particular story, but did manage to recover some pages from this one too!

This story starts off with a teenage group in some unnamed school, meeting up in the morning. This is a modern day (? not right now per say, a couple decades after this century, but not wrecked enough to call it dystopian exactly)

Then there's your stereotypical evi organisation which is conducting unknown experiments on humans to give them superpowers for their unknown cause, and they come to the school to test on kids, except our favourite local group creates their own rebel group and fight their way out of the school

Only to end up in the clutches of that evil organisation, and get pumped with mysterious chemicals

Cue to the third and final installment of the series, the Rise of A.L.P.H.A

I once again, found a local document lying around with a few of the old chapters, feel free to go through it :D

# The Rise of ALPHA

I don't remember a large chunk of this story, but it starts off with the 6 or 7 kids of the original group from the last book in various different parts of the Earth.

Someone is under the deep ocean in the Pacific, someone is in a terrorist encampment, while someone else is in the lower orbit of the planet. Yes, it was a mess

Then that alien child from the first book comes, gathers these kids up, fights off the evil corporation called the A.L.P.H.A, which was stylised as APA, like this ->

*i hope you can see how apa translates to alpha?*

But yeah after that they come up into the space, fight off the Dark Lord Cranius, and story ends :)

Yeah not the most original plot ever created, but hey I was 14, cut me some slack

### Webnovel incident
soo... some representatives from the official webnovel acocunt reached out to me via a personal message on Wattpad, that month when Legendary Solars hit #1 on #save-the-earth for a straight month.

Webnovel was a novel writing and reading platform launched in 2017, so around 2018 when I was contacted, they were still a relatively not so well-known website for stories. Atleast I wasn't too informed about them back then
They said they really liekd that story, and would be interested in signing me up for a small paid creators program on their site! If interested, reach out to their official email asking for a representative

I actually did text them, and they reached out to me too, explaining the creators program, which now that I read, was actually really nice starting out. The question now is, what did I say to them.

Nothing. My 9th grader ass ghosted them, and their second follow up mail too, because of exams and the fact that I forgot to check my emails regularly and just kept posting on Wattpad. I would have slapped my 14 year old self so hard like oh god that was such a good oppurtunity for me man why the fuck did i fumble that so badly oh GOD 

# on a side note...

I found my school time crush's old blog on poems. I won't go into too much detail, just in case she ever comes across this, but it brought back some fun memories.

The funniest of them being, me commenting "very poggers i like this !"

😭😭😭You really didn't think of anything better to comment did you

Anyways I think that was quite a long post, I think I'll sing off now

Thank you reader, for listening to my very random rant on online forums for writing stories

See you again soon!
