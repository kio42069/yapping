# house.md

I have noticed a few, unusual and funny things around my house which I think would be fun to share

Yesterday, the doorbell rang, but the person pressing the button doesn't let it go. So its just going "Triinnnnnnnnnnnnnnn...". Sister goes towards the door, screams and comes into the living room. "We have got a doorbell ghost, there is nobody at the door yet its ringing". Natually I call her bullshit brain out and walk towards the door, to see the blinkit guy standing a bit far away with our order laughing at reels, and the doorbell button just stuck in there, glitched into the socket like a regular button 😭 LOL

Recently they shifted the entire temple area into the living room because its well conditioned, but considering how we barely have any space for new things (yeah I get my trinket collection genetically), they pushed our TROPHIES ON THE BOTTOM SHELF WITH THE OTHER BORING TRINKETS (a few seashells from Puri, Odissa, a sand sculpture thing inside a photo frame, I'll attach a picture of something similar below, 2 bells from switzerland [tujhe dekha toh ye jaana sanam waale], random ceramic miniture recreations like the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Colloseum, Colliseum? idk im writing in vscode man I don't got a spell check here :( some random govt buildings and stuff but yeah random stuff) like wow okay sure that's totally cool (I don't really care that much) OH yes i forgot the coolest trinket on the bottom shelf. A perplexus my dad got from his trip from brazil. That thing single handedly kept me and my cousins entertained for a decade.

# Projects

This a section which entirely deserves to be skipped past but I'll try to make a short and interesting

### Software

This summer I got a few projects made, partially if not completely atleast

The first thing I did was port Hyprmonitor into a better codebase. It looks nice now, pretty (decently) documented and expandable to be used in a node project. Of course, I will eventually make a react frontend, what do you think I am, a devil who uses the cli to track his screen time? Ofcourse not I am better than that

Secondly, the intern project. I'd make the claim that it's actually really good looking and works decently (the backend is not ready at the moment but hey atleast the forntend and databases are up, that counts for something right?)

Thirdly, the Qualcomm hackathon project I had almost completed before we got the mail that we were not selected. No shots will be taken at anyone for this, it is what it is, our idea wasn't too good anyways. It was an improved, snappier, faster file search as an alternative for windows search. The final idea was to use their copilot tools to integrate that into the project, so that the user can just go "oh i wanna find the presentation i made 15 years ago on breeding vapo-" yeah you get the gist of it

Finally, this blog. It took like a day to complete, and took heavy inspo from [another neocities page](https://0oxo0.neocities.org/) but hey it's up. The inital mailing list feature I was implementing ws supposed to be fully automated, using an Upstash Redis cache to check if any new posts are out, and if yes then use a Sendgrid API to send that mail out to all the subscribers on Netlify Forms. Alas, cursor + my ass couldn't figure it out properly and ended up spamming myself 20 mails every minute. That was pretty bad. Anyways atleast it's up now

There was another fun project idea somay gave me, but it's a bit large scale, even though it is a hella cool idea. I'm not sure how much I can give away here but I'll just say enough to remind me if I ever read this post in like 10 years from now. Automated Github, okay surt? Cool done nice mhm that would make complete sense to me in 10 years totally

### Hardware

It has also been a long while since I have made any electronics project, and I want to make a couple of ideas, nothing solid yet (hideo kojima mentioned?)

- Something to do with led matrices, maybe [a clock of some kind?](https://www.instructables.com/Cloxel-WLED-Pixel-Clock) or maybe a led cube (looking at you aarav)
- Something to do with music, maybe a miniature casette player of some kind? An ipod clone? Unsure
- Something to do with wearables, accessories, some cool lighting / audio / haptic feedback kind of product that I can fidget around with while its hanging on my bag straps or fro my pants or something
