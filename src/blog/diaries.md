## The Original Notes Diary

![cn diary](https://kiddofour.netlify.app/images/old.jpg)

For anyone who hasn't come across this diary yet (rare tbh), this has been an integral diary in my life for about a year now. I took all my Computer Network notes in here, my leetcode and CP1 scribbles, project ideations, whenever I had to explain something to someone and had to write / draw it out, my cutting board for stickers duing 1Pixel 2025, this has been through it all AHAHAHAHAHA

I bought this from daryaganj because cmon the cover is so sick bro you can't resist buying such a beauty

Another really fun part of the diary that encouraged me to use it instead of ditching it after a while were the scribbles prashi made in here. They usually span one or two pages, randomly anywhere inside the the diary, stuff like this ⤵

![scribbles](https://kiddofour.netlify.app/images/prashi.jpg)

Yeah hella mesmerising, and a fucking jumpscare when you are speedwriting notes and get hit by an entire page of exquisite art. Hilarious

and yeah I think its the first notebook or diary I have almost completely filled out in years it was very fun, which is why I got the next diary, once again, from daryaganj

## The Spam Journal

![junk](https://kiddofour.netlify.app/images/junk.jpg)

Now this one has not been filled out as much yet, barely 10 or 15 pages up until now, but the idea for this one was to store and paste any stickers, bills, menu, whatever junk i find lying around which have some kind of a story attached to them. Or just general scribbles

Like,
- A couple of Mr. Diy reciepts, when I bought small trinkets for my sister and a few friends
- The bill from Govinda's when I went there with Kepi and we both got thalis and nobody ended up finishing theirs 😭
- My decathlon bills 😋 for my skatebaord and my skateboard gear
- Some bookstore merch, I will not drop the name its a very cool place shuddup
- A page pasted, with just the word balls written 100s of times all over? I think I wrote that while watching the screening of dead poets society by lda in the lecture hall, and I was pretty bored becasue I had no clie wtf was going on.
- Some taco bell and mcd offer cards
- Club and keyboard stickers
- Tame Impala lyrical spam with glitter pens
- California Burrito bills, because a lot of times when I go there with someone, I collect some story or lore its just so fun 
- The thank you notes some restaurants send u with ur swiggy order
- A random skull-esque sunny fanart (shadow slave reference)
- A todo list?

![reciept](https://kiddofour.netlify.app/images/reciept.jpg)

Yeah this is for when I am bored, idts it will get completed anyday soon, it'll atleast take a few years to reach even halfway, and its getting pretty bloated already lol

## The 1Px Notebook(s)

![1px nbs](https://kiddofour.netlify.app/images/1px.jpg)

1Pixel in an annual design conference/fest type of thing which is held in our college anually. It is arguably one of the most fun times of the year, close to maybe Odyssey, but considering they can't even pull that off now, yeah

So in 1px, they give you bags of merch, and in the 2023 version of the event, they gave these isometrically dotted notebooks, and I knew I had to get my hands on another as soon as I got one, because I started filling it up IMMEDIATELY with project ideations. It was just so much fun to ideate projects which ranged from being really complicated to stuff which was really simple, things I knew I would never make, but just drawing it out neatly is a very fun thing to do!

![1px nbs](https://kiddofour.netlify.app/images/idea.jpg)
*like here, I was ideating some desktop held electronic sand timer thingies, wtaf i forgot what they are called. Sandgalsses? No clue*

Speaking of 1px and design, next up are the adobe notebooks

## The Adobe Merch

![adobe](https://kiddofour.netlify.app/images/adobe.jpg)

Once again, this is a 1px merch item, a 2024 one to be precise

![ada notes](https://kiddofour.netlify.app/images/ada.jpg)

I took my Algorithm Design and Analysis course's notes in this, but yeah this notebook is a pretty boring one, nothing much has happened with it. Unlike the next two diaries, also bought at daryaganj, but not at the sunday book market

## The Kiddo42069 Diary

![kiddo42069](https://kiddofour.netlify.app/images/kiddo.jpg)

This was the first dire notebook I had in a decently long time, wrote that front text with some whitener BWAHAHAHA

The contents of it were nothing too serious or important, just some schizo drawings, font ideas, a couple of sparce diary entries when day's went good yet unhappening, and some todo/planning

But it is a notebook which incites joy whenever I spot it. Very fun notebook 10/10 recc to buy one too it was like 30 rupees only hella cheap

## The Rant Diary

![rant](https://kiddofour.netlify.app/images/rant.jpg)

That's a BAD diary. I used to write in it when times were bad and this diary is there to cope in when shit is bad but not bad enough to rant about to humans. Or ai for that matter either. This should not be used. Bad times. Nope

## The Mini Diary

![smol](https://kiddofour.netlify.app/images/mini.jpg)

Kepi got this for me, and it's a fun diary to keep around in your pocket or bag. It's very small, lightweight, and hella useful when you quickly need to jot something down while let's say in a meeting or someone tells you some information that you need to save and draw and phone isn't a viable option

## The Vintage Journal

![vintage diary, outside](https://kiddofour.netlify.app/images/vintage.jpg)

FUck yeah this was a hardcover I got from ShopABC, they have a website and a page on instagram, and are reputed enough, also their packaging is just out of the world?? Like it's absolutely phenomenal and I really don't want to spoil it for you, I'd rather you buy something from them for your friends' birthdays and get the experience firsthand it's so good

![vintage diary, inside](https://kiddofour.netlify.app/images/vintage-in.jpg)

Not much inside this yet, because I legit got this like a week ago, but I'll use it for the regular journals I write like twice a month, but it's just so pretty inside it's hard to write boring or random shit inside

![vintage diary, inside but another photo](https://kiddofour.netlify.app/images/vintage-in-2.jpg)

## The Birthday Diary

![19th bday merch](https://kiddofour.netlify.app/images/bday.jpg)

Got this from my campus friends on I think my 19th, second year. Another banger gift bro ong, they also gave like an Anya figurine and a nikon lens mug, so fkin cool. I don't have a lot written in it, the cover is just oh so exquisite I don't wanna open it I just wanna watch it all the time it's such a peak diary

## The (not a diary) Book of Charles Dickens

![1px nbs](https://kiddofour.netlify.app/images/charles.jpg)
![1px nbs](https://kiddofour.netlify.app/images/charles-side.jpg)

Yeah it's just a really cool hardcover I got for like 50 or 100 from Daryaganj, It's a book. But looks epic

## The School Diary

![1px nbs](https://kiddofour.netlify.app/images/school.jpg)

On first sight, this looks hella insconspicuous.

HOWEVER, this has the most lore out of everything above, well it's probably a tie between this and [the original notes diary](#diary-1---the-original-notes-diary).
To give a brief summary of what this notebook was used for, I should make a mini list

- Logo ideation for the Rise of Alpha (yes [that one](https://kiddofour.netlify.app/blog/patience#the-rise-of-alpha))
- Rough, terrible sketches of my classmates/friends from school
- Encrypted story for my stories, since I didn't trust anyone in school to not steal that (or maybe I just knew it was cringe and didn't want anyone to read it), and since I only got to access wattpad for a limited amount of time at home, I precooked my stories and just types them out to post instead of thinking while typing it out
- Games which we used to play on paper at school
- Haikus?
- Random Scribbles
- Some sst and cs notes, god I used to think cs is so fun i'd be writing so much html and css code all through my degree 🤣🤣🤣
- A birthday db for my classmates

# Closing thoughts

I just hope I end up using these diaries more often, that's all.

And I know the images are hella high quality and might have taken wuite a while for em to load up, it was liek 300 mbs worth of 20 photos 💀 goodluck people with poopy ass ram

byebye!
