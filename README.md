# My Blog

A no-bullshit blog built with Vite + React, because I'm tired of social media BS.

## Why this exists
- Because of the ai generated low quality slop
- Because of the bombardment of personalised ads  
- Because of the absolute shithousery of bot accounts

Dead internet theory be looking pretty real rn.
